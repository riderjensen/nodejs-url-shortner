#Nodejs URL Shortner

This is a pet project that I have created, it is meant to be very flexible and easy to set up. The goal is to provide something lightweight that can be easily customized but that also has features that are important. This URL shortner can be an MVC or a restful API service depending on the settings that you choose when you first configure the application.


Instructions for setup:

1. Make sure that you have mongodb installed
2. Clone the repository
3. npm install all dependencies
4. Edit the settings at the top of app.js
5. Start the server and everything should work
